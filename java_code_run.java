//Java code execution follows a series of well-defined steps, transforming your high-level code into machine-executable instructions. Here’s how it happens step by step:
//        1. Writing the Code
//You write Java source code in a  file.
//        2. Compilation
//The Java compiler () translates the human-readable Java code into bytecode—a platform-independent, intermediate representation stored in  files.
//3. Class Loading
//The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) loads the  files into memory using the ClassLoader.
//        4. Bytecode Verification
//The JVM verifies the bytecode to ensure security and consistency before execution.
//Interpretation or Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)
//
//6. Execution
//The JVM executes the converted code, interacting with system resources like CPU and memory.
//7. Garbage Collection
//Java's automatic Garbage Collector cleans up unused objects to free memory.
//Example Workflow
//Let’s say you have a simple Java program:
